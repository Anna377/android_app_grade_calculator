This is an Android app that calculates a final grade for a course based on user input.
The user inputs values for attendance, group presentation, two midterms, a final project,
and up to five homework assignments. The app applies weighted percentages to these values
and calculates a final grade.

The following is a brief overview of the different parts of the code:


Import statements
These are import statements that import classes and functions from the Android and Kotlin
standard libraries.


MainActivity class
This is the main activity of the app that extends the AppCompatActivity class.


Properties
sharedPreferencesKey: A String constant that is used as the key for accessing and storing values in SharedPreferences.
homeworkFields: A mutable list of EditText fields that store values for up to five homework assignments.
attendance, groupPresentation, midterm1, midterm2, finalProject: EditText fields that store values for attendance, group presentation, and the two midterms and the final project, respectively.
calculateButton: A Button that the user clicks to calculate the final grade.
finalGrade: A TextView that displays the calculated final grade.
addButton: A Button that the user clicks to add a new homework assignment.
homeworkField: An EditText field that stores the value for a new homework assignment.
homeworkLayout: A LinearLayout that holds the EditText fields for homework assignments.
homeworkButtons: A LinearLayout that holds the buttons for adding and resetting homework assignments.
resetAllGrades: A Button that the user clicks to reset all input fields.
resetButton: A Button that the user clicks to reset only the homework assignments.


Variables
homeworkCount: An integer that tracks the number of homework assignments currently displayed.
total: A double that stores the sum of all homework grades.
avg: A double that stores the weighted average of all grades.
onCreate() function
This function is called when the activity is created. It initializes all of the properties and variables and sets up the event listeners for the buttons. It also loads the values for attendance, group presentation, midterms, and final project from SharedPreferences.


Helper functions
getEditTextValue(): This function takes an EditText field and returns its integer value. If the field is empty or not a valid integer, it returns 0.


Event listeners
resetButton.setOnClickListener(): This event listener is triggered when the user clicks the "Reset" button for the homework assignments. It clears the values of all homework assignments.
addButton.setOnClickListener(): This event listener is triggered when the user clicks the "Add" button for a new homework assignment. It adds a new EditText field to the homework layout if there are fewer than five homework assignments displayed.
resetAllGrades.setOnClickListener(): This event listener is triggered when the user clicks the "Reset All" button. It clears the values of all input fields.
calculateButton.setOnClickListener(): This event listener is triggered when the user clicks the "Calculate" button. It retrieves the values of all input fields, calculates the weighted average of all grades, and displays the result in the finalGrade TextView.
